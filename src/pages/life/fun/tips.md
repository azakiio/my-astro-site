## Tips on making tips

Episode 1

- Intro: we both got part time server jobs
- Have you been a server before?
- Whatâ€™s it like?
- Current average tip
- We would need to keep track of tip percentages for a few weeks

Tips increased by 56% for servers who introduced themselves when greeting their tables.

- Do you greet customers rn? Do you intro yourself?
- Implement and see how it goes for the next few weeks
- Do servers pay attention to how much is tipped? or not really? Like you just put in the numbers and then printing the receipt after tip.

Maybe an episode every 2 weeks
